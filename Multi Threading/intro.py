multithreading in Python.

**What Is a Thread?**
- A thread is a separate flow of execution.
It allows different parts of your program to run concurrently.

- In Python, threads do not always execute at the same time
due to the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL). They appear to run
simultaneously but actually take turns executing.

- To create and manage threads, you can use the `threading`
module from the standard library.

**Creating Threads:**
- Import the `Thread` class from the `threading` module.
- Instantiate a new thread using the `Thread` class.

Here's an example:
```python
from threading import Thread

def my_function():
    print("Hello from a thread!")

# Create a new thread
my_thread = Thread(target=my_function)
my_thread.start()  # Start the thread
my_thread.join()   # Wait for the thread to finish
```

**Common Tools for Python Threading:**
1. **ThreadPoolExecutor**: Allows you to manage a pool of worker threads.
2. **Locks**: Used to prevent race conditions by synchronizing access to shared resources.
3. **Queues**: Provides thread-safe data structures for communication between threads.
4. **Semaphores**: Control access to a limited number of resources.
5. **Timers**: Schedule tasks to run after a specified delay.
6. **Barriers**: Synchronize multiple threads at a specific point.

Remember that Python threads are best suited for I/O-bound tasks
(e.g., network requests, file I/O) rather than CPU-bound tasks.
If you need true parallelism, consider using multiprocessing.
