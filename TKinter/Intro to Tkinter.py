Tkinter: is the standard Python module for creating and managing graphical
user interfaces (GUIs) using the Tk and Ttk widget toolkits.
Here are some key points:

What Is Tkinter?
-Tkinter provides a cross-platform way to build desktop applications
-with a consistent look and feel.
-It allows you to create windows, buttons, labels, menus, and other GUI elements.
-Tkinter is available on most Unix platforms (including macOS) and Windows systems.

Basic Usage:
-To use Tkinter, import it using import tkinter.
-Create a main application window using Tk().
-Add widgets (buttons, labels, etc.) to the window.
-Start the event loop using mainloop().

Modern API:
-Tkinter supports both the old and new APIs.
-The new API (introduced in Tcl/Tk 8.5) provides themed widgets and
a more Pythonic experience.
-Check out the TkDocs tutorial for recommended approaches using the modern API.
